In the summers after first year every friend of mine was giving an interview in my college for a role in the Student Council, I had made up my mind to follow what I started last summers, Programming,  to excel in the field of computer science.I had decided I will join CodeCell, a Campus chapter of Codechef. I knew almost all members of CodeCell when I was in my first year.They had guided me throughout my first year. But life had different plans.

After the Students' Council interviews were over. I got a message from the new creative head, he wanted me to help with the college festivals website. Well it was a great opportunity to gain experience.So I thought about it and dicussed it with the seniors from CodeCell and agreed on helping the council.Now when people started to come to know about this I got wierd comments from people wanting to join the council but were not selected.I ignored all that and started making the first website.

Now, the creative head was helping me with the design and images I needed for the website and I had to execute everything on my own uhh! I had Google though!.Creative head asked me for features that were challenging and at the same time really awesome. And I agreed to execute almost all of it.And started doing whatever I could to do what the head asked me to do.It was a good experience for me and I went from basic Jquery to Advance Jquery.


### My project setup:
- **FrameWorks**: Materialize Css, JQuery,Skrollr.js.
- **Languages**: Html, Javascript and Sass(Css preprocessor)
- Sublime text as my primary editor

Now the first one month in developing the website went smooth and it was fun too.But as the release date approached the creative head and marketing team use to ask me whether the website was ready or not almost twice a day.I also started putting more efforts to complete the project as soon as possible. Also simulataneously I was preparing for ACM-ICPC with my team and Yes I was selected in CodeCell and was working for that council too.(What was my experience in the CodeCell well that’s a story for another post).

Now during the week before when the website was going to release I didn’t sleep for more than an hour,had not talked to my younger brother for a while infact did not go to my house for 3 days straight.It was intense but I did it. I completed the website and released it. It was an awesome experience and man coding for 15+ hours straight is fun!.

Although, I was not completely satisfied with the final product but I was happy that I had finished my first project. You can check out the website at kjsce-abhiyantriki.org. Abhiyantriki is our technical fest Also we organized a the first ever Hackathon in Abhiyantriki (Via Team CodeCell.) More on that in the post on CodeCell and the experience I had there.

Now currently I am developing two more website for Skream (Sports fest) and Symphony(Cultural Fest).My area of interest lies in Machine learning and Algorithms which I will be concentrating on soon after I complete these websites.
