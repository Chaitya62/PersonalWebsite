Hello, It's been a long time since I blogged about almost anything. Recently, I have been learning great deal of new technologies. Here is one technology. I beleive all software developers must be aware of. This is not a new or cutting-edge tech. It has been around for almost 9 years now. Yet many browsers have only recently started supporting it and many few devs are aware or know how this technology works.

In this blog, I'll explain you this technology in the way, I understood it. I don't claim this to be the absolute truth about it and I may dumb down a few things for making it lucid.
But, if you find something incorrect or false which might be conceptually wrong drop me a message or a comment below. I'll try to fix it. Other reason of writing this blog, while I was trying to get a grasp of this tech it was tough for me to find a proper resource that explained everything clearly with a proper coding example that was easy to understand.

Enough banter let's start. 

So webRTC is a project that allows Web Browsers and mobile applications to develop complex RTC application using a simple API. You can have a solid RTC application without having to write any low level RTC programs on your own by using the simple API. This API provides 2 functionalities for the developer on the application: 

1. Get User Media

2. Setup a peer-to-peer connection
